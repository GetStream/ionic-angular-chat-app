# Ionic Chat App using Stream Angular SDK

This is a demo application which uses Ionic and [Stream Angular SDK](https://staging.getstream.io/chat/docs/sdk/angular/) for building a Chat application that works on the web and on Android and iOS (using Capacitor)

You can check out [setting up an Ionic app with Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/getting-started/with-ionic) and [The Angular SDK Tutorial](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-angular/blob/master/tutorial/tutorial.md)

Here's how it looks on a Pixel 2 Android Emulator:

<!-- ## Set Up Your Ionic Environment

To set up your environment, you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Ionic CLI](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/cli) installed globally.

Create a new ionic application using the CLI:

```bash
ionic start
```

For the framework, choose Angular. Give your project a name, and choose a blank template.

### Install Dependencies

This app uses [Capacitor with Ionic](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/getting-started/with-ionic) as a native runtimne. So we need the following:

```bash
npm install @capacitor/app @capacitor/haptics @capacitor/keyboard @capacitor/status-bar
npm install @capacitor/android @capacitor/ios
```

The first line consists of plugins required for capacitor to work and for best user experience.

The second line consists of plugins required for our native environments. -->
